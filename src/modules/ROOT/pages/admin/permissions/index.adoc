= {PRODUCT_NAME} Permission System

One of the main focuses when working with any kind of data in the enterprise environment is the data integrity and security, especially when working with sensitive information.
{PRODUCT_NAME} takes this seriously and defines a powerful permission system that allows you to control access to any resource, being an application or a single module field.

[NOTE]
====
Resource level permissions are described in detail in the following sections.
This section merely outlines the system.
====

{PRODUCT_NAME} uses Role-based access control (RBAC) as a method of restricting access based on the roles of individual users within the system.
RBAC lets users have access rights only to the parts of the system/application they need and prevents them from accessing information that doesn't pertain to them.
By default, a user is assigned to "Everyone" role which is very limited due to security (in case someone uninvited registers to your system, they won't see any data, {APP_NAME_MESSAGING} channels, list of applications, etc.).

[NOTE]
====
The first registered user is granted admin rights by default.
====

Each permission can be in one of the following states:

Inherit::
    To check the setting in the layer above.
    For example: if an individual application has access permissions set to "Inherit", it will use the permission set for _All_ applications (default: "Deny").
    Explicit "Allow" or "Deny" always override the Inherit value,
Allow::
    To allow the role to perform the operation over a specified resource,
Deny::
    To deny the role to perform the operation over a specified resource.

[TIP]
====
It's good practice to limit system users a much as possible to avoid potential security breaches.
====

Permissions setting is fine-grained, meaning the system administrator can control permissions on several layers, for example:

* which role can access applications
* which role can read the data
* which role can edit the data
* which role can access admin area, etc.

== Access control check flow

The overall flow of verifications if a role has access to perform an operation on a resource is the following:

* Can this combination of roles perform an operation on this specific resource
* Can this combination of roles perform an operation on any resource of the type (wildcard)
* Can anyone/everyone perform an operation on this specific resource
* Can anyone/everyone perform an operation on any resource of the type (wildcard)

The check will return:

* Inherit when:
** No roles are given
** More than 1 role is given and one of the given roles is Everyone

* Deny when:
** There is one rule with Deny value

* Allow when:
** There is at least one rule with Allow value (and no Deny rules)

[NOTE]
====
Permissions in the Admin Panel are general and can be overwritten.
====

== Tips and tricks

=== Modular approach

We suggest a modular role design, where we define multiple roles with a smaller set of permissions.
For example:

* **CRM admin**: only provides administration privileges for the CRM,
* **Messaging admin**: only provides administration privileges for the messaging,
* **System admin**: only provides administration privileges for the system.

Then we can easily "stick" these roles together when creating users.

[NOTE]
====
There is no limit to the number of available roles or to the amount of members a role can have.
